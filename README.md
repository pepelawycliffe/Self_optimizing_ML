# Self_optimizing_ML
In this demo, we show the core idea of a self-optimizing ML modeling:  Running an optimization loop wrapped over a ML algorithm to optimally meet a target of not only the ML performance but something else - a business goal, a computational cost burden, a complexity measure, etc.
